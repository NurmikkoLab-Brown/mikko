    """
    Class for the Kalman Filter Decoder
    Parameters
    -----------
    C - float, optional, default 1
    This parameter scales the noise matrix associated with the transition in kinematic states.
    It effectively allows changing the weight of the new neural evidence in the current update.
    Our implementation of the Kalman filter for neural decoding is based on that of Wu et al 2003 (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2178-neural-decoding-of-cursor-motion-using-a-kalman-filter.pdf)
    with the exception of the addition of the parameter C.
    The original implementation has previously been coded in Matlab by Dan Morris (http://dmorris.net/projects/neural_decoding.html#code)
